# Multitasking

Here is an example of the simplies round robbin scheduler using Timer/Counter 0. Slightly reworked comparing to the iinitial example from ECE4760 for testing the hardware setup (see [Sched1GCC644.c](https://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/courses/ece4760/labs/s2012/Sched1GCC644.c "Sched1GCC644.c")).  
No serial communication, 4 tasks, and the button handling on push/release.
