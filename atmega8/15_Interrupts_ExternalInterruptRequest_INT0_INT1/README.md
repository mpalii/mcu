### External interrupts (Two-button counter project)

Two buttuns conntected to the controller. The first one increments the accumulator value per one (with external interrupt INT0), the second one decrements the accumulator value per one (with external interrupt INT1). 
Stored values range for accumulator - from 0 to F (decimal 15). Accumulator value displayed to the seven-segment display with common cathode. Static lighting.  
Current limiting resistors - 300 Ohm.  
Pull-down resistors - 2200 Ohm.  
Supply voltage - 5V.  

**NOTE: no debounce solutions.**
